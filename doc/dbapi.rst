Functions
---------

.. function:: pg8000.connect([user, host=localhost, unix_sock, port=5432, database, password, socket_timeout=60, ssl=False])
    
    Creates a connection to a PostgreSQL database.

    This function is part of the `DBAPI 2.0 specification
    <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_; however, the arguments of the
    function are not defined by the specification.  pg8000 guarentees that for
    all v1.xx releases, no optional parameters will be removed from the
    function definition.

    :param user:
        The username to connect to the PostgreSQL server with. If this is not
        provided, pg8000 looks first for the PGUSER then the USER environment
        variables.

    :keyword host:
        The hostname of the PostgreSQL server to connect with.  Providing this
        parameter is necessary for TCP/IP connections.  One of either ``host``
        or ``unix_sock`` must be provided. The default is ``localhost``.

    :keyword unix_sock:
        The path to the UNIX socket to access the database through, for
        example, ``'/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432'``.  One of either ``host`` or
        ``unix_sock`` must be provided.

    :keyword port:
        The TCP/IP port of the PostgreSQL server instance.  This parameter
        defaults to ``5432``, the registered common port of PostgreSQL TCP/IP
        servers.

    :keyword database:
        The name of the database instance to connect with.  This parameter is
        optional; if omitted, the PostgreSQL server will assume the database
        name is the same as the username.

    :keyword password:
        The user password to connect to the server with.  This parameter is
        optional; if omitted and the database server requests password-based
        authentication, the connection will fail to open.  If this parameter
        is provided but not requested by the server, no error will occur.

    :keyword socket_timeout:
        Socket connect timeout measured in seconds.  This parameter defaults to
        60 seconds.

    :keyword ssl:
        Use SSL encryption for TCP/IP sockets if ``True``.  Defaults to
        ``False``.

Generic Exceptions
------------------
pg8000 uses the standard DBAPI 2.0 exception tree as "generic" exceptions.
Generally, more specific exception types are raised; these specific exception
types are derived from the generic exceptions.

.. exception:: pg8000.Warning(exceptions.StandardError)

    Generic exception raised for important database warnings like data
    truncations.  This exception is not currently used by pg8000.

    <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_.

.. exception:: pg8000.NotSupportedError(DatabaseError)

    Generic exception raised in case a method or database API was used which is
    not supported by the database.

    This exception is part of the `DBAPI 2.0 specification
    <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_.


Specific Exceptions
-------------------
    
Exceptions that are subclassed from the standard DB-API 2.0 exceptions above.

.. exception:: pg8000.ArrayContentNotSupportedError(NotSupportedError)

    Raised when attempting to transmit an array where the base type is not
    supported for binary data transfer by the interface.

.. exception:: pg8000.ArrayContentNotHomogenousError(ProgrammingError)

    Raised when attempting to transmit an array that doesn't contain only a
    single type of object.

.. exception:: pg8000.ArrayContentEmptyError(ProgrammingError)

    .. versionadded:: 1.07


Classes
-------

.. class:: Connection

    A connection object is retuned by the :func:`pg8000.connect` function.
    It represents a single physical connection to a PostgreSQL database. It has     the following methods:

    .. method:: cursor()

        Creates a :class:`Cursor` object bound to this
        connection.

        This function is part of the `DBAPI 2.0 specification
        <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_.

    .. method:: commit()
    
        Commits the current database transaction.

        This function is part of the `DBAPI 2.0 specification
        <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_.

    .. method:: rollback()

        Rolls back the current database transaction.

        This function is part of the `DBAPI 2.0 specification
        <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_.

    .. method:: close()

        Closes the database connection.

        This function is part of the `DBAPI 2.0 specification
        <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_.

    .. method:: tpc_begin(xid)

        Begins a TPC transaction with the given transaction ID xid.

        This method should be called outside of a transaction (i.e. nothing may
        have executed since the last .commit() or .rollback()).

        Furthermore, it is an error to call .commit() or .rollback() within the
        TPC transaction. A ProgrammingError is raised, if the application calls
        .commit() or .rollback() during an active TPC transaction.

        This function is part of the `DBAPI 2.0 specification
        <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_.

    .. method:: tpc_prepare()

        Performs the first phase of a transaction started with .tpc_begin(). A
        ProgrammingError is be raised if this method is called outside of a TPC
        transaction.

        After calling .tpc_prepare(), no statements can be executed until
        .tpc_commit() or .tpc_rollback() have been called.

        This function is part of the `DBAPI 2.0 specification
        <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_.

    .. method:: tpc_commit([ xid ])

        When called with no arguments, .tpc_commit() commits a TPC transaction
        previously prepared with .tpc_prepare().

        If .tpc_commit() is called prior to .tpc_prepare(), a single phase
        commit is performed. A transaction manager may choose to do this if
        only a single resource is participating in the global transaction.

        When called with a transaction ID xid, the database commits the given
        transaction. If an invalid transaction ID is provided, a
        ProgrammingError will be raised. This form should be called outside of
        a transaction, and is intended for use in recovery.

        On return, the TPC transaction is ended.

        This function is part of the `DBAPI 2.0 specification
        <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_.

    .. method:: tpc_rollback([ xid ])

        When called with no arguments, .tpc_rollback() rolls back a TPC
        transaction. It may be called before or after .tpc_prepare().

        When called with a transaction ID xid, it rolls back the given
        transaction. If an invalid transaction ID is provided, a
        ProgrammingError is raised. This form should be called outside of a
        transaction, and is intended for use in recovery.

        On return, the TPC transaction is ended.

        This function is part of the `DBAPI 2.0 specification
        <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_.

    .. method:: tpc_recover()

        Returns a list of pending transaction IDs suitable for use with
        .tpc_commit(xid) or .tpc_rollback(xid).

        This function is part of the `DBAPI 2.0 specification
        <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_.

    .. attribute:: notifies

        A list of server-side notifications received by this database
        connection (via the LISTEN/NOTIFY PostgreSQL commands).  Each list
        element is a two-element tuple containing the PostgreSQL backend PID
        that issued the notify, and the notification name.

        PostgreSQL will only send notifications to a client between
        transactions.  The contents of this property are generally only
        populated after a commit or rollback of the current transaction.

        This list can be modified by a client application to clean out
        notifications as they are handled.  However, inspecting or modifying
        this collection should only be done while holding the
        :attr:`notifies_lock` lock in order to guarantee thread-safety.

        This attribute is not part of the DBAPI standard; it is a pg8000
        extension.
        
        .. versionadded:: 1.07

    .. attribute:: notifies_lock

        A :class:`threading.Lock` object that should be held to read or modify
        the contents of the :attr:`notifies` list.

        This attribute is not part of the DBAPI standard; it is a pg8000
        extension.

        .. versionadded:: 1.07

    .. attribute:: Error
                   Warning
                   InterfaceError
                   DatabaseError
                   InternalError
                   OperationalError
                   ProgrammingError
                   IntegrityError
                   DataError
                   NotSupportedError

        All of the standard database exception types are accessible via
        connection instances.

        This is a DBAPI 2.0 extension.  Accessing any of these attributes will
        generate the warning ``DB-API extension connection.DatabaseError
        used``.

    .. attribute:: autocommit

    Following the DB-API specification, autocommit is off by default. It can be
    turned on by setting this boolean pg8000-specific autocommit property to
    True.

    .. versionadded:: 1.9

.. class:: Cursor

    A cursor object is returned by the :meth:`~Connection.cursor` method of a connection.
    It has the following attributes and methods:

    .. attribute:: arraysize

        This read/write attribute specifies the number of rows to fetch at a
        time with :meth:`fetchmany`.  It defaults to 1.

    .. attribute:: connection

        This read-only attribute contains a reference to the connection object
        (an instance of :class:`Connection`) on which the cursor was
        created.

        This attribute is part of a DBAPI 2.0 extension.  Accessing this
        attribute will generate the following warning: ``DB-API extension
        cursor.connection used``.

    .. attribute:: rowcount

        This read-only attribute contains the number of rows that the last
        ``execute()`` or ``executemany()`` method produced (for query
        statements like ``SELECT``) or affected (for modification statements
        like ``UPDATE``).

        The value is -1 if:
        
        - No ``execute()`` or ``executemany()`` method has been performed yet
          on the cursor.
        - There was no rowcount associated with the last ``execute()``.
        - At least one of the statements executed as part of an
          ``executemany()`` had no row count associated with it.
        - Using a ``SELECT`` query statement on PostgreSQL server before older
          than version 9.
        - Using a ``COPY`` query statement on PostgreSQL server version 8.1 or
          older.

        This attribute is part of the `DBAPI 2.0 specification
        <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_.

    .. attribute:: description

        This read-only attribute is a sequence of 7-item sequences.  Each value
        contains information describing one result column.  The 7 items
        returned for each column are (name, type_code, display_size,
        internal_size, precision, scale, null_ok).  Only the first two values
        are provided by the current implementation.

        This attribute is part of the `DBAPI 2.0 specification
        <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_.

    .. method:: execute(operation, args=None, stream=None)

        Executes a database operation.  Parameters may be provided as a
        sequence, or as a mapping, depending upon the value of
        :data:`pg8000.paramstyle`.

        This method is part of the `DBAPI 2.0 specification
        <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_.

        :param operation:
            The SQL statement to execute.

        :param args:
            If :data:`paramstyle` is ``qmark``, ``numeric``, or ``format``,
            this argument should be an array of parameters to bind into the
            statement.  If :data:`paramstyle` is ``named``, the argument should
            be a dict mapping of parameters.  If the :data:`paramstyle` is
            ``pyformat``, the argument value may be either an array or a
            mapping.

        :param stream: This is a pg8000 extension for use with the PostgreSQL 
            `COPY
            <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-copy.html>`_
            command. For a COPY FROM the parameter must be a readable file-like
            object, and for COPY TO it must be writable.

            .. versionadded:: 1.9.11

    .. method:: executemany(operation, parameter_sets)
    
        Prepare a database operation, and then execute it against all parameter

.. class:: pg8000.Bytea(str)

    Bytea is a str-derived class that is mapped to a PostgreSQL byte array.
    This class is only used in Python 2, the built-in ``bytes`` type is used in
    Python 3.

.. class:: pg8000.Interval

    An Interval represents a measurement of time.  In PostgreSQL, an interval
    is defined in the measure of months, days, and microseconds; as such, the
    pg8000 interval type represents the same information.

    Note that values of the :attr:`microseconds`, :attr:`days` and
    :attr:`months` properties are independently measured and cannot be
    converted to each other.  A month may be 28, 29, 30, or 31 days, and a day
    may occasionally be lengthened slightly by a leap second.

    .. method:: __init__(self, microseconds, days, months)
    
        Initializes an Interval instance with the given values for
        microseconds, days, and months.

    .. attribute:: microseconds

        Measure of microseconds in the interval.

        The microseconds value is constrained to fit into a signed 64-bit
        integer.  Any attempt to set a value too large or too small will result
        in an OverflowError being raised.

    .. attribute:: days

        Measure of days in the interval.

        The days value is constrained to fit into a signed 32-bit integer.
        Any attempt to set a value too large or too small will result in an
        OverflowError being raised.

    .. attribute:: months

        Measure of months in the interval.

        The months value is constrained to fit into a signed 32-bit integer.
        Any attempt to set a value too large or too small will result in an
        OverflowError being raised.
